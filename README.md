# Spotify Top 100 in 2018

From an open source I found on Kaggle. Based on many inspiring data analysis reports by data scietists, data analysts and students, I was motivated to try learn to make the trend analysis. 

### This analysis includes
- Analysing top artists by the number of artist's song lists on Top 100
- Comparison of similarities amongst different categories using heatmap
- Futher analysis of individual category e.g. danceability, energy, loudness
